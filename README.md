# MRR-Wafer-Mapping-Automation
I want to make it clear that I had AI help me create this. I did not know where to get some of the numbers for the Q value so I had Gemini come up with some for me. With that out of the way, this is a program to sort Micro-Ring Resonance base on Q values, Coupling Gaps (coup_g), and the radius of ring. I did this using a CSV file from kraggle.com
